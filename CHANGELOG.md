# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.41

### Added

- Added strict-provider-friendly team tool schema shapes and config schema coverage for result delivery controls.
- Added resilient result watcher fallback polling for resource-limit watch failures and partial JSON retry handling.
- Added `runtime.completionMutationGuard` (`off`/`warn`/`fail`) with structured `task.attention` events when implementation-style workers complete without observed mutations.
- Added group-join mailbox delivery metadata, request-id dedupe, ack observability, timeout events, and dashboard/status visibility.
- Expanded `team doctor` and `team status` with schema, async/result delivery, worktree/readiness, attention, transcript, and group-join diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Recovered adaptive implementation planner output when compaction truncates the end marker but complete phase objects are still present.

## 0.1.40

### Added

- Added owner-session generation guards for background subagents, async run notifications, result watchers, and live-session callbacks so stale sessions do not receive completions.
- Added `runtime.requirePlanApproval` with approve/cancel API support to gate mutating adaptive implementation tasks behind an explicit planner artifact approval.
- Added shared secret redaction for event logs, mailbox persistence, artifacts, JSONL streams, agent records, notifications, metrics, and diagnostics.

### Changed

- Project-local agents, teams, and workflows can no longer shadow builtin or user resources with the same name.
- Project-level sensitive config such as worker execution, runtime mode, autonomy, agent overrides, worktree setup hooks, and OTLP headers is ignored with warnings unless configured in trusted user scope.

### Fixed

- Fixed lost async completion notifications after auto-compaction/session restart by continuing to track active runs across notifier restarts.
- Fixed stale background subagent wakeups after session switch/shutdown while preserving terminal results for explicit joins.
- Fixed resume bypasses in plan approval by re-gating persisted mutating adaptive tasks when approval state is missing or pending.
- Restricted plan approval and cancellation to non-read-only roles and rejected cancel/approve after the approval state is no longer pending.

## 0.1.39

### Fixed

- Made CI test execution deterministic across Node 22/macOS/Linux/Windows by running Node test files sequentially to avoid cross-file environment races.
- Fixed live-agent durable control symlink-file rejection to return an API error instead of throwing from the tool handler.
- Tightened symlink artifact security assertions so tests check leaked file contents rather than safe metadata paths.

## 0.1.38

### Added

- Added parent-session wake-up for completed background subagents so the main agent automatically joins results and continues the original task.
- Added stronger resource/parser coverage for team role metadata and workflow task-body headings.

### Changed

- Clarified the current default worker execution model and local disable controls in project guidance.
- Aligned config schema constraints for UI settings with the published package schema.

### Fixed

- Hardened subagent abort handling so stopped records are persisted and late runner completion does not regress them to completed/error.
- Fixed blocked subagent result joins, blocked duration persistence, and final wake-up after blocked runs resume to terminal status.
- Blocked path traversal through workflow shared artifacts, run ids, imported run bundles, task-scoped mailbox APIs, agent runtime files, and untrusted artifact/transcript paths; hardened reads/writes with realpath containment to prevent symlink escapes; bound live-agent control to the selected run.
- Documented actual project resource paths for `.crew/` and `.pi/teams/` layouts.

## 0.1.31

### Fixed

- Added required Agent Skills frontmatter (`name` and `description`) to built-in coding skills so Pi loads them without conflicts.
- Tightened built-in skill package coverage to require standards-compliant frontmatter.

## 0.1.30

### Added

- Added Phase 6 async hardening: jiti loader resolution/fail-fast, async startup marker files, and early background-runner exit detection.
- Added worker concurrency hard cap with explicit `limits.allowUnboundedConcurrency` opt-out and observability event.
- Added persisted model routing metadata on tasks and agent records: requested model, resolved model, fallback chain, reason, and used attempt.
- Added self-contained architecture/runtime-flow docs and five built-in coding skills.
- Added mailbox replay on resume for pending inbox messages, including task-scoped messages.
- Added task resume checkpoints and recovery for crash-after-final-stdout and crash-after-artifact-write child-process tasks.
- Added async notifier detection for quiet dead background runners with durable `async.died` events.
- Added adaptive planner repair for malformed JSON, oversized task plans, and common role aliases before blocking implementation runs.
- Added package snapshot coverage for Phase 6 docs, skills, Pi manifest entries, and the runtime `jiti` dependency.
- Added `src/subagents/*` consolidation entrypoints for child spawning, background runner commands, and subagent manager APIs.
- Split `team-tool.ts` actions into focused status, inspect, lifecycle, cancel, and plan modules while preserving public action names.
- Split `register.ts` lifecycle wiring into command, team-tool, subagent-tool, and artifact-cleanup registration modules.
- Added async restart recovery integration smoke coverage for stale background pids.
- Added explicit recursive subagent depth and read-only role spawn-denial tests.

### Changed

- Async background runs now use an explicit jiti loader path and expose startup markers for recovery/health checks.
- Active batch selection now caps excessive user concurrency by default to protect local machines.
- Resume now emits mailbox replay metadata before restarting queued work.
- Child-process tasks now persist checkpoint phases (`started`, `child-spawned`, `child-stdout-final`, `artifact-written`) during execution.
- Split `task-runner.ts` prompt/progress/state/live helpers into focused modules while keeping `runTeamTask` as the public entrypoint.
- Moved live-session access behind `src/subagents/live/*` and dynamic task-runner imports so default child-process flow does not eagerly load live runtime code.

### Fixed

- Background runner startup failures are reported earlier instead of silently leaving queued/running manifests stale.

### Release prep notes

- Suggested next release grouping: `0.1.30` for Phase 6 runtime hardening, resume recovery, model observability, docs/skills, and internal refactors.
- Gate run locally: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- No breaking public API changes: tool actions, slash commands, config schema, and package name remain stable.

## 0.1.29

- Republished the child worker response timeout fix as a fresh npm version.

## 0.1.28

- Fixed child-process workers being terminated after only 15 seconds of quiet provider/tool time by increasing the default response watchdog to five minutes and clarifying the timeout error message.

## 0.1.20

- Reworked the implementation workflow into an adaptive planner-led orchestration flow that decides the number, roles, and phases of subagents from the task instead of using a fixed fanout template.
- Added dynamic adaptive task injection, persisted adaptive task metadata, and resume reconstruction for planner-selected subagent steps.
- Block implementation runs when the planner does not produce a valid adaptive plan, including missing/unreadable planner artifacts and malformed/oversized plans.
- Added tests for adaptive plan parsing, dynamic batch fanout, invalid-plan blocking, writer-role support, and adaptive resume recovery.
- Hardened subagent/runtime fixes from post-0.1.19 review: env-isolated depth tests, foreground failure status updates, generic tool conflict aliases, and max_turns propagation.

## 0.1.19

- Added Claude-style `Agent`, `get_subagent_result`, and `steer_subagent` tools backed by pi-crew's durable worker runtime, plus conflict-safe `crew_agent`, `crew_agent_result`, and `crew_agent_steer` aliases.
- Added a durable subagent manager with background queueing, completion notifications, result joins, session-bound cleanup, and direct single-agent runs via `team run agent=...`.
- Disabled risky auto-opening of the right sidebar by default, added foreground completion notifications, and reduced duplicate widget/sidebar UI.
- Added progress coalescing and workflow concurrency helpers to keep foreground sessions responsive during busy worker output.
- Fixed live-session runs being classified as scaffold when workers are enabled and hardened session switch/shutdown cleanup for foreground child processes.

## 0.1.18

- Added a built-in `parallel-research` team/workflow for map-reduce style source audits with dynamic `Source/pi-*` fanout and parallel explorer shards.
- Made the live right sidebar the default foreground UI: active foreground runs auto-open a top-right live sidebar when the terminal is wide enough.
- Added live sidebar sections for active agents, waiting tasks, completed agents, task graph, model, tool, and token/usage details.
- Stopped materializing queued dependency tasks as child-process agents; status now separates active agents, waiting tasks, and completed agents.
- Added workflow-aware default concurrency so research/parallel-research can use ready parallel work instead of always running one worker.
- Dropped user/system prompt messages from child event persistence to avoid prompt/context leakage in agent event logs.
- Tightened child event compaction with separate assistant/tool input/tool result caps and improved powerbar active/waiting/model/token summaries.

## 0.1.17

- Fixed terminal/completed workers being incorrectly escalated as stale heartbeat blockers after all tasks completed.
- Cleaned child-process result extraction so result artifacts prefer final assistant output and no longer include worker prompt/context.
- Made `/team-dashboard` visibly render as a top-right sidebar by default with explicit right-sidebar title text.
- Added per-subagent model and usage fields to agent records, status output, and dashboard fallbacks so model/token totals stay visible while and after workers run.

## 0.1.16

- Added right-side `/team-dashboard` placement with model, token, and tool detail rows for subagents.
- Added UI config for dashboard placement/width and model/token/tool visibility.
- Foreground child-process runs now continue without blocking the interactive chat and remain tied to session shutdown.
- Child-process observability now drops noisy `message_update`/encrypted thinking deltas and stores compact events to prevent massive JSONL/output logs from freezing sessions.
- Cancel now syncs agent records and writes a foreground interrupt request so queued/running agents stop appearing stale.

## 0.1.15

- Child-process model selection now uses Pi-configured/available models and auto-discovers provider/model entries from Pi settings/models config.
- Added configured-model fallback chains for worker runs instead of forcing builtin provider hints.
- Fixed skipped task agent records so they no longer appear queued.

## 0.1.0

- Initial scaffold for `pi-crew`.
- Added Pi package manifest, extension entry, minimal team tool, slash commands, builtin resources, and documentation placeholders.
